# OpenCV-toolbox
## Description
The code for this OpenCV toolbox was written in both C++ and MATLAB to design a basic GUI to implement basic OpenCV functions on images. This
was done as a semester project for the Visual Perception module, Masters in Computer Vision (MSCV - VIBOT), Universty of Burgundy.
A good amount of help was taken from the book titled
"Computer Vision Applciation programming cookbook" which you can also find in this repository".

## How to use
Both the GUI's are very simple to use. Just load your desired image, choose an OpenCV function given in the drop down list and press apply.

###C++
You need to configure your .pro file to include OpenCV library

###MATLAB
Refer to the MATLAB user manual given as a pdf in this repository.
